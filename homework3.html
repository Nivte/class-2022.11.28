      A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a
      patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread
      roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
      pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard,
      mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand
      Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A
      hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]

    <h2>Etymology and terminology</h2>
    <p>
      The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg, the second-largest
      city in Germany; however, there is no certain connection between the food
      and the city [4] (see History below). Hamburger and fries in Tokyo By
      back-formation, the term "burger" eventually became a self-standing word
      that is associated with many different types of sandwiches, similar to a
      (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as buffalo in
      the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, chicken, turkey, elk, lamb or fish
      like salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is
      the case of the veggie burger.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      As versions of the meal have been served for over a century, its origin
      remains ambiguous.[6] The 1758 edition of the book The Art of Cookery Made
      Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as "Hamburgh
      sausage", which suggested to serve it "roasted with toasted bread under
      it". A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name "Rundstück
      warm" ("bread roll warm") in 1869 or earlier,[7] and supposedly eaten by
      many emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted
      beefsteak rather than Frikadeller. It has been suggested that Hamburg
      steak served between two pieces of bread and frequently eaten by Jewish
      passengers travelling from Hamburg to New York on Hamburg America Line
      vessels (which began operations in 1847) became so well known that the
      shipping company gave its name to the dish.[8] Each of these may mark the
      invention of the hamburger, and explain the name.

    <h3>Claims of invention</h3>
    <p>
      The origin of the hamburger is unclear, though "hamburger steak
      sandwiches" have been advertised in U.S. newspapers from New York to
      Hawaii since at least the 1890s.[10] The invention of hamburgers is
      commonly attributed to various people, including Charlie Nagreen, Frank
      and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, Fletcher Davis, or Louis
      Lassen.[11][12] White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to
      Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase.[13] Some have pointed
      to a recipe for "Hamburgh sausages" on toasted bread, which was published
      in The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse in 1747.[10]
      Hamburgers gained national recognition in the U.S. at the 1904 St. Louis
      World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as "the
      innovation of a food vendor on the pike".[12] No conclusive argument has
      ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: "One
      problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the
      spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny
      vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that
      more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different
      parts of the country."

    <h4>Louis Lassen</h4>
    <p>
      Although debunked by The Washington Post,[10] a popular myth recorded by
      Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro stated the first hamburger served
      in America was by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, after he opened Louis'
      Lunch in New Haven in 1895.[15] Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New
      Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak
      sandwich in the U.S. in 1900.[16][17][18] New York Magazine states that
      "The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named
      the meat on a bun after themselves years later", noting also that this
      claim is subject to dispute.[19] A customer ordered a quick hot meal and
      Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty
      and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast.[12] Some critics
      like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for New York Magazine, claim that this
      sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.[20]
    </p>
    <h4>Charlie Nagreen</h4>
    <p>
      One of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a
      meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair[21] now sometimes
      called the Outagamie County Fair.[20] The Seymour Community Historical
      Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as "Hamburger
      Charlie", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly
      selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could
      eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the
      hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were
      familiar.
