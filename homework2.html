    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The FIFA World Cup is a professional association football tournament held
      between national football teams.[4] Organised by FIFA, the tournament,
      held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[5] and has
      been contested by 32-teams since the 1998 event.[5] The tournament is
      contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for
      16 teams.[6] The defending champions are the French national football
      team, who defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final.[7] The
      event is scheduled to take place from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and
      July, the 2022 World Cup will be played in November and December to avoid
      the intense Qatari summer heat. As a result, the World Cup will be
      unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of domestic football
      leagues, which start in late July or August, including all of the major
      European leagues, which have been obliged to incorporate extended breaks
      into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European
      competitions have scheduled their respective competitions group matches to
      be played before the World Cup, in order to avoid playing group matches
      the following year.[9] The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July
      2020.[10] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four
      matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs
      Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar successfully lobbied FIFA to
      allow their team to open the tournament.[11][12] The final will be played
      on 18 December 2022 at the Lusail Iconic Stadium.[13][10] The matches for
      each group were allocated to the following stadiums

    <h2>Host selection</h2>
    <p>
      The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in
      January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register
      interest.[18] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup,
      but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[19][20] and Indonesia's bid was
      rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football
      Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee
      to support the bid.[21] Indonesian officials had not ruled out a bid for
      the 2026 FIFA World Cup, until Qatar was awarded the 2022
      tournament.[citation needed] After UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018
      event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in
      2022.[citation needed] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA
      World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.
      The 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December
      2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[22] Two FIFA
      executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to
      allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[23] The decision to host
      the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having "high operational
      risk",[24] generated criticism from media commentators.[25] It has been
      criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals.[26]

    <h3>Host selection criticism</h3>
    <p>
      There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection
      process involving FIFA's executive committee members. These allegations
      are being investigated by FIFA (see § Bidding corruption allegations,
      below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior
      officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being
      held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption have been made relating to
      how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation
      and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael
      J. Garcia has since described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing
      "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."[28] In May
      2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption
      and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.[29][30]
      In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had
      used "black ops", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the
      hosting rights.[31] Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in
      securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor,
      Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who
      picked the winner in 2010.[32] Qatar has faced strong criticism due to the
      treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup,
      with Amnesty International referring to "forced labour" and poor working
      conditions,[33][34] while many migrant workers reported having to pay
      large "recruitment fees" to obtain employment.[35] The Guardian newspaper
      reported that many workers are denied food and water, have their identity
      papers taken away from them, and that they are not paid on time or at all,
      making some of them in effect slaves. The Guardian has estimated that up
      to 4,000 workers may die due to lax safety and other causes by the time
      the competition is held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government
      adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a
      minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system.
      According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions
      of the foreign workers have not improved in the last years.[36] Qatar is
      the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup –
      the next smallest by area is Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup,
      which is more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host
      16 teams instead of the current 32. Qatar also became only the second
      country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World
      Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a
      previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World
      Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they
      qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the
      tournament, six are located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the
      first World Cup since 1930 where most of the stadiums are in one city.
      While this decreases the distance that fans and players will need to
      commute, Qatar itself is struggling to accommodate the amount of arriving
      fans with its diminutive amount of space.[37] Due to Qatar's laws on
      alcohol consumption, World Cup organizers have announced the creation of
      designated "sobering up" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of
      intoxicated fans during the World Cup.[38] Qatar's World Cup chief
      executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al
      Khater, was cited by Sky News ensuring safety for implementing the
      designated sobering-up areas, "It's a place to make sure that they keep
      themselves safe, they are not harmful to anybody else."[39] According to
      ESPN, if a fan is sent to the "sobering up" zone, they will be permitted
      to leave when they can display clearheaded behavior.[40]
